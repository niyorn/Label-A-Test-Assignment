**Link to project:** https://label-a-star-wars.netlify.com/ <br/>

**Description:**</br>
This project serve as learning process to get a better understanding of React.js and at the same time it is assignment from the company: **Label A** to see if my code skills is good enough for the company.

core functionality of the app is to display all Categories of the Star Wars API and when clicked: to show all available items.

This project was created in: ~ 8 hours


## Process

To get a basic understanding of React I've started with watching this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBws8MSXN7A). This video covers: state, props, JSX, events.

Thereafter I've looked up how to create a basic React project and stumble onto the create-react-app cli. `create-react-app` is the command that I've created my project with.

Then I've looked up for the best way to fetch data in React and with the help of this [tutorial](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-fetching-data/) I've been able to fetch the data.

After a lot of struggling in displaying the data I've used this [tutorial](https://flaviocopes.com/react-how-to-loop/) to create a loop and render the data.

The last step was adding a Router to navigate through the different pages.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Todo
- [ ] add search item
- [ ] add Loading indicator when fetching data
